Video Editing using Basics of OpenCV

The main video is Video.mp4
The code to produce the video is code.ipniy
The rest of the files are the inputs for the video (Input1.mp4 and Input2.mp4), the Template for Template Maching (template.jpg) and the image for replacement (emoji.jpg)

The goal was to make a 1 minute video showing off some of the capabilities of OpenCV.

Through the video it shows:
- Grayscale/ RGB Colorscale
- Filters: Gaussian Blur and Bilateral Filtering
- Catching Objects with RGB, HSV colorscale, Dilation and Opening echiniques
- Sobel Edge Detection
- Circle Detection with Hough Transform
- Template Matching
- Object Tracking and Replacement
- Detecting Different Shape Objects
