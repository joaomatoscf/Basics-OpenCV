Video Editing using Basics of OpenCV

1. **Video.mp4**: Main Video (Output)
2. **code.pym**: Main Code to produce the Video.mp4
3. **input1.mp4**: File with part of the input video
4. **input2.mp4**: File with part of the input video
5. **template.jpg**: Template for Template Maching
6. **emoji.jpg**: Image for replacement

The goal was to make a 1 minute video showing off some of the capabilities of OpenCV.

Through the video it shows:
- Grayscale/ RGB Colorscale
- Filters: Gaussian Blur and Bilateral Filtering
- Catching Objects with RGB, HSV colorscale, Dilation and Opening echiniques
- Sobel Edge Detection
- Circle Detection with Hough Transform
- Template Matching
- Object Tracking and Replacement
- Detecting Different Shape Objects
